# MODIS MOD10A1 Glacier Albedo Analysis

## Abstract

This repository presents a comprehensive analytical framework for examining glacier albedo temporal dynamics utilizing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD10A1 snow cover products. The implementation employs Google Earth Engine computational infrastructure to process multi-decadal datasets (2010-2024) with rigorous quality assurance protocols and advanced statistical methodologies for climate change research applications.

## Introduction

Glacier surface albedo represents a critical parameter in climate system dynamics, governing energy balance processes and influencing ablation rates. The MOD10A1 Collection 6.1 snow cover product provides systematic observations of snow and ice albedo derived from Terra satellite measurements at 500-meter spatial resolution with daily temporal coverage.

This analytical framework addresses the need for standardized, reproducible glacier albedo trend analysis through implementation of conservative quality filtering, robust statistical methods, and comprehensive metadata preservation suitable for peer-reviewed research applications.

## Methodology

### Data Sources and Processing

The analysis utilizes the MODIS/Terra Snow Cover Daily Global 500m Grid (MOD10A1) Collection 6.1 dataset accessed through Google Earth Engine. Primary data products include:

- Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover fraction
- Snow albedo daily measurements
- Quality assessment flags and algorithm confidence indicators
- Cloud state and geolocation accuracy metadata

### Quality Assurance Protocol

Data filtering employs a multi-stage quality control framework:

**Stage 1: Basic Quality Assessment**
- Exclusion of night observations (flag value 211)
- Removal of ocean pixels (flag value 239) 
- Elimination of poor quality observations (flags 2-3)

**Stage 2: Algorithm-Specific Filtering**
- Cloud detection screening using Collection 6.1 protocols
- Algorithm confidence thresholds
- Sensor viewing geometry constraints
- Atmospheric correction quality indicators

**Stage 3: Spatial-Temporal Constraints**
- Minimum glacier fraction coverage thresholds (default: 75%)
- Temporal aggregation reliability minimums (≥10 valid pixels)
- Seasonal analysis windows (default: June-September)

### Statistical Analysis Methods

#### Trend Detection
Sen's slope estimator provides robust, non-parametric trend quantification resistant to outliers and non-normal distributions. The method calculates median slope values across all data point pairs, providing confidence intervals through bootstrap resampling.

#### Change Point Analysis
Structural break identification employs piecewise linear regression with breakpoint optimization through least squares minimization. Multiple change points are detected using dynamic programming algorithms with Bayesian Information Criterion selection.

#### Anomaly Detection
Standardized anomalies are calculated using z-score transformations based on long-term climatological means and standard deviations. Extreme events are identified using threshold criteria (|z| > 2.0) with temporal persistence requirements.

#### Autocorrelation Assessment
Temporal persistence analysis employs autocorrelation functions to quantify serial correlation patterns and identify characteristic time scales of albedo variability.
